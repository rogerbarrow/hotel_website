        <p>I've stayed here a few times, and it is BY FAR the best Hotel in the Texas. They blow me away continually.
          The resort is lovely, but the staff make it amazing. This stay, Amy, the front desk supervisor, made me feel
          welcome beyond belief. Please pass along!

        <p>We had a great experience at VisPas, spotless rooms, beautiful location, great breakfast buffet, excellent
          service. One of my favorite hotels.
          They accommodated all our evacuation needs.
          No cancellation fees which was very helpful.</p>
